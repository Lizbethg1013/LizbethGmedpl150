    <h1>Homework 4 Image 1</h1>

    <p>For my first image, I chose to alter the exposure to enhance my image. However, I also bring life to the photograph with hues and saturated colors like blue and yellow. I chose this photo because it was visually appealing to me, and I believed I could use different adjustment layers to make the image less dull and bring out its true potential. </p>
