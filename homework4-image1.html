    <h1>Homework 4 Image 1</h1>

    <p>The concepts I am exploring with this first image are blending modes. The first two modes I used were masking to remove unwanted white cast from the background, as well as to remove the scenery behind the man in the middle. The second technique I used was blending mode, which led me to use the picture of the man to merge all of my images into one piece. To achieve this look, I changed the color and tone of each image to black and white in order not to distract the viewer from any details. I then used a blending mode option called darken in order to complete this integration. The images I found were from public domains, but some came from news outlets. Overall, I made these choices to bring the issue of immigration rights to light.  </p>
