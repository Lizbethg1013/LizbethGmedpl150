<p>1st reflection</p>
  <p>Chapter one of Susan Sontag's On Photography, "In Plato's Cave," introduces photography as both limiting and a fundamentally powerful means of viewing and understanding the world. She defends an argument that photographs alter our conception of the truth, similar to how people mistake shadows for reality, Sontag states. The ethical and cultural analysis of this is discussed in this chapter, as well as by Sontag, who looks at photography as a way of enriching our worldview and a protection that keeps us from seeing things as they really are. Sontag presents the idea that "To collect photographs is to collect the world.". This concept is significant in that it proposes photography is less about the preservation of memories and more about defining the deconstruction of the perception of reality. A photograph is almost immediately an icon of experience, proof that a person has experienced or witnessed something. In the photographing world, where individuals tend to take pictures in an effort to document experiences rather than recollect them, this speaks profoundly about Sontag's argument. Sontag makes another point that photographs can make the world truer than actual life in the public's eyes, such as traveling to an iconic location and not photographing can be an incomplete experience, as if a photograph is the actual evidence of one's presence. Images do not represent reality, Sontag maintains. They are merely context, frame, and selectively dependent. Thus, they’re both compelling and insidious.  People do not usually subject photographs to scrutiny because they are perceived to be objective and provide the illusion of truth. This is where the importance of Plato's cave allegory lies: we risk getting our images mixed up with the entire reality of what they are standing for, whereas the prisoners get the shadows mixed up with reality.  This compels us to look at how far images, as a substitute for direct contact, control our perception of the world. Sontag's reading of photography's social power is another pivotal aspect of the chapter. She recognizes that photographs can be a possessive and dominating act because taking a photograph can be an act of attributing meaning to one's life and demarcating it in terms of limits. As such, photography is inevitably linked with power relations. But by presenting remote realities—catastrophes, conflicts, and civilizations—at the forefront of people far removed from them, photographs can democratize access to experience. While prolonged exposure to glimpses of misery may undermine moral reaction, it can also sharpen sympathy and desensitize. In an era of digital media, when we are constantly moved by an endless scene of images, this anomaly is as relevant today as ever. After reading this chapter, I use photography and image making to signify what brings me joy and to document stories, but also consider seeing through the picture and embracing what is in front of me. I represent visuals through this use of imaging by using my mind and interpreting more than what is perceived by the naked eye. For instance, using a single person standing in an open field, which signifies yearning for freedom and peace.

<p>Homework 6 reflection</p>
<p>Through the graphic novel "Motherhood in Crisis," there are chapters consisting of stories from women who have suffered trauma in their town and face challenges due to a lack of resources. But, despite these obstacles, they have found solutions to these issues. Chapter 2- Heela: The schoolgirl ‘My stolen future’ shares Heela’s story, where someone in her town, unfortunately, rapes her. After this traumatic event, seek refuge in the Rainbo Centre for counselling. Illustration was used to convey the story's message to the reader through images, and this visually allows readers to understand the climate of each situation. Each story being told through illustration combines text, drawings, photography, and video. Visually, the illustrations vary from the photographs because, with self-expression and imagination, stories are being told in a way our brain can translate stories being told to us orally. The advantage they may present in comparison to text-only or photography is the satisfaction of seeing stories come to life through an artistic point of view. </p>

<p>Homework 13 reflection</p>
<p>W.J. Hennigan's New York Times essay The Rising Risk and How We Stop It is a piece that discusses the difficulties occurring in Ukraine. The piece serves as a sharp reminder that the threat of nuclear warfare, once considered blinded by the public since the end of the Cold War, is back at the centre stage, and therefore an urgent priority. Hennigan believes that the world is now what experts are calling the “New Nuclear Age”, after decades of relative stability. Nuclear arsenals are being modernised and expanded, long-established arms control treaties are breaking down, and the chances of nuclear weapons being used in present-day conflicts increase every day. What stuck with me about this piece is that it shows that many people hold the view that the possibility of nuclear warfare is “unimaginable”, or should be batted an eye. This attitude leads to complacency. Hennigan’s point that the nuclear weapons of today, while not as large in explosive power as the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, could produce an equally catastrophic effect if used in conflict, demonstrates the alarming reality regarding the future use of nuclear weapons. In addition, the dramatic fact that both Ukraine’s and America’s governments are currently preparing for potential nuclear detonations (use of radiation detectors, stockpiling medical supplies) indicates how much more realistic these fears have become. This revelation has led me to consider the risk and the way humans perceive it, and I found a contradiction in society's understanding of existential threats. We frequently do not take the most serious threats seriously until it is too late. The situation regarding nuclear war is a good illustration of this; the potential for such destruction is so unimaginable that many people will not think about or discuss the matter. However, this very avoidance creates an increased potential for destruction, due to the necessity of active policy discussions and proactive measures to prevent and prepare for it. Hennigan’s essay addresses the psychological barrier preventing us from viewing things realistically as we look at geopolitical tensions, and encourages readers, as well as indirectly policymakers, to look at global tensions through a realistic lens, in a world in which global peace is achieved through cooperation and mutual respect between nations. Along with Hennigan’s assessment of the risks associated with nuclear war and other threats, he focuses on the lack of global structural mechanisms for reducing those risks. The global arms control framework of the 20th century was an important structural mechanism for reducing nuclear conflict; however, that infrastructure has deteriorated. International peace treaties, or a new start, and other confidence-building measures are weaker than they have ever been, and there is virtually no longer diplomatic engagement between nuclear powers. In the end, this article has clarified for me that nuclear weapons should be viewed not just as historical artifacts, but also as significant contributors to our world today in shaping Global Politics. By acknowledging the existence and fragility of current containment measures, this article represents an important step toward the future of nuclear weapons, and it highlights the importance of thinking about such things beyond what we may perceive as negative. Hennigan successfully makes it known to readers that when we imagine the unimaginable, it is not a form of despair but rather a way to display our responsibilities as citizens.<p>
