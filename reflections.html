<h1>Reflections</h1>

<p>This is my first reading reflection</p>
  <p>Chapter one of Susan Sontag's On Photography, "In Plato's Cave," introduces photography as both limiting and a fundamentally powerful means of viewing and understanding the world. She defends an argument that photographs alter our conception of the truth, similar to how people mistake shadows for reality, Sontag states. The ethical and cultural analysis of this is discussed in this chapter, as well as by Sontag, who looks at photography as a way of enriching our worldview and a protection that keeps us from seeing things as they really are. Sontag presents the idea that "To collect photographs is to collect the world.". This concept is significant in that it proposes photography is less about the preservation of memories and more about defining the deconstruction of the perception of reality. A photograph is almost immediately an icon of experience, proof that a person has experienced or witnessed something. In the photographing world, where individuals tend to take pictures in an effort to document experiences rather than recollect them, this speaks profoundly about Sontag's argument. Sontag makes another point that photographs can make the world truer than actual life in the public's eyes, such as traveling to an iconic location and not photographing can be an incomplete experience, as if a photograph is the actual evidence of one's presence. Images do not represent reality, Sontag maintains. They are merely context, frame, and selectively dependent. Thus, they’re both compelling and insidious.  People do not usually subject photographs to scrutiny because they are perceived to be objective and provide the illusion of truth. This is where the importance of Plato's cave allegory lies: we risk getting our images mixed up with the entire reality of what they are standing for, whereas the prisoners get the shadows mixed up with reality.  This compels us to look at how far images, as a substitute for direct contact, control our perception of the world. Sontag's reading of photography's social power is another pivotal aspect of the chapter. She recognizes that photographs can be a possessive and dominating act because taking a photograph can be an act of attributing meaning to one's life and demarcating it in terms of limits. As such, photography is inevitably linked with power relations. But by presenting remote realities—catastrophes, conflicts, and civilizations—at the forefront of people far removed from them, photographs can democratize access to experience. While prolonged exposure to glimpses of misery may undermine moral reaction, it can also sharpen sympathy and desensitize. In an era of digital media, when we are constantly moved by an endless scene of images, this anomaly is as relevant today as ever. After reading this chapter, I use photography and image making to signify what brings me joy and to document stories, but also consider seeing through the picture and embracing what is in front of me. I represent visuals through this use of imaging by using my mind and interpreting more than what is perceived by the naked eye. For instance, using a single person standing in an open field, which signifies yearning for freedom and peace.
