    <p> When I was first introduced to this assignment, I imagined a scene with peaceful elements, and animals also came to mind, so I ultimately ended up imagining a scene with animals and a field of grass. Though the search was hard, I found a little lamb in a field of grass looking into the abyss. Though my drawing depicts something different, this was my intent. I wanted to make a drawing-like image to draw on the use of imagination for my illustrator project.
