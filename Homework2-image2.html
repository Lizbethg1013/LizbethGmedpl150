    <h1>Homework 2 Image 2</h1>

    <p>With my second image I chose to represent Hunter and its very proud colors while including a building that has not been modernized because I find the building to be beautifully made. I present this by using a color and tone to change the saturation to a deep purple to bring out the colors that represent Hunter. Changing the commonly used edits made to photographs, I make this piece visually interesting to my audience.</p>
