<p>I am a New York City based student aspiring to delve into the many aspects of media and various apps and websites used to create projects. I wish to become a media maker because of the impact this can have on a community no matter how small a project may seem. They all carry meaning or even significance behind them, which is what I want to do myself! My brother studied graphic design and after a final project he invited us to view his work and I noticed how everyone's work seemed to carry a significance behind them no matter how known or visually telling they can be. This experience then lead me to media studies which offers a broad spectrum of focuses within the major. Topics I would like to explore include immigration rights, mental health awareness, and more.  </p>
