<p> I am a New York City-based student aspiring to explore the many aspects of media, particularly the apps and websites used to create meaningful projects. I wish to become a media maker because I admire that even the smallest project can carry deep significance and impact a community. My brother, who studied graphic design, once invited us to view his final project, and I was struck by how each studentâ€™s work held its own meaning, whether it was subtle or visually telling. That experience is what led me to pursue media studies, a field that offers a wide range of possibilities for creative expression. While pursuing media studies, I hope to explore topics such as immigration rights, mental health awareness, and other social issues that carry a deep tone in a community.  </p>
