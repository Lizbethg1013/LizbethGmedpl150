    <p>The concepts I am exploring with this second image are blending modes. The first two modes I used were masking to remove settings from the background. The second technique I used was blending mode, which led me to use the lipstick  in order to blend each layer seamlessly, as they all had their own tones. To achieve this look, I changed the color and tone of each image to similar hues in order not to distract the viewer from any out-of-place images. The images I found all came from public domains. Overall, made these choices to bring to light the issue of gender inequality and the standards that are placed on women to be feminine and coquettish, hence the lipstick being given to the ballerina. </p>
